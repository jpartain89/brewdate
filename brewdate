Usage: brewdate
[ -h, --help | -q, --quiet ]

This is a simple wrapper script that just auto-runs:

    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew cleanup
    brew prune
    brew doctor
    brew cask update
        and
    brew cask doctor

The -q and --quiet options attempt to silence ALL output into a log file.
